## Features

### Advanced Visualization Components

- **Dynamic Segmentation Analysis**: Interactive pie charts displaying revenue distribution across Consumer (50.56%), Corporate (30.74%), and Home Office (18.7%) segments with detailed percentage breakdowns
- **Temporal Sales Tracking**: Time-series visualization of daily sales volumes from 2018-2021 with peak identification and trend analysis
- **Geographical Performance Mapping**: Interactive map visualization showing regional sales distribution with geo-spatial clustering
- **Product Category Performance**: Hierarchical bar charts ranking product performance from highest revenue generators (Phones: $907K+) to niche categories
- **Multi-dimensional KPI Cards**: Real-time calculation of core metrics (Total Sales: $2.30M, Profit: $286.40K, Discount: $1.56K, Quantity: 38K)

### Interactive Filtering Capabilities

- Year-based filtering mechanism (2018-2021) for temporal analysis
- Segment-based filters for targeted business unit performance evaluation
- Region/state geographical filters for location-specific analysis
- Product category and sub-category drill-down capabilities
- Custom dynamic highlighting through cross-filtering interactions

### Key Business Insights Revealed

- West region leads with 31.58% of sales while South shows highest profit margin at 17.2%
- Consumer segment represents 50.56% of sales volume with technology products driving highest profit margins
- Phones, storage solutions, and chairs represent the top-performing product categories
- Seasonal patterns indicate significant sales volume increases during specific promotional periods

## Data Architecture

The dashboard is powered by a structured data model with:

- **Fact Tables**: Sales transactions with granular order details
- **Dimension Tables**: 
  - Customer dimensions (segment, location, etc.)
  - Product dimensions (category, sub-category, etc.)
  - Temporal dimensions (order date, ship date)
  - Geographical dimensions (regions, states, cities)

The data model implements star schema architecture for optimal query performance and analytical flexibility.

## Technical Implementation
